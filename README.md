A "rock, paper, scissors" game for The Odin Project.

It's the first JavaScript project for the curriculum. I had a lot of fun with this one. It felt like solving a riddle in a way. This project taught me a lot about planning and breaking problems down more manageable ones. I think it was also a great introduction to how global scope vs local scope works.
